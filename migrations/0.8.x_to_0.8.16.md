Migrate from 0.8.x to 0.8.16
===

## Configuration

Add `kind` and `version` properties at the top of your configuration:

```yaml
kind: GithookCompanionConfiguration
version: 0.8.16
```

`version` expresses what minimum binary version is compatible to your configuration

### Sync

Remove the deprecated `enabled` property:

```yaml
sync:
    enabled: true
```

Add old defaults to `sync` block:

```yaml
sync:
    parent: true
    binary: true
```

You can know granulary define if your want to sync the parent configuration and the binary.

The `binary` property now defaults to `false` : the minimum version check will prevent the command to run if there is no compatibility between binary and configuration versions anymore.
